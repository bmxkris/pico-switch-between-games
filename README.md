# pico-switch-between-games

I've written two games for the same circuit, each game can be found here:
[https://github.com/bmxkris/pico-led-race]
and here:
[https://github.com/bmxkris/pico-led-reaction]

copy the code.py file from each repo to the RP2040 and name them `picoledrace.py` and `picoledreaction.py` respectively. Moving the slide switch and restarting the board (power cycle) will switch between one game and the other.
